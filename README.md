## The hackathon project for converting Unstructure Data to Structred Data

Tables and forms are a very common way to organize information in structured documents. Their recognition is fundamental for the recognition of the documents. Indeed, the physical organization of a table or a form gives a lot of information concerning the logical meaning of the content. 

The requirement of detection and identification of tables from document images is crucial as tables contain important information, and also most of the layout analysis methods fail in the presence of tables in the document image. 

To build a solution that can detect tables and its layout in a given documents, then make sense of the information they present. Tables present in documents are often used to compactly communicate important information in rows and columns. To automatically extract this information by digitization of paper documents, the tabular structures need to be identified and the layout and inter-relationship between the table elements need to be reserved for subsequent analysis.

The same is being achieved by me and my friend (https://github.com/agabhi017). We hope you'll like it. :)
